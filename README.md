## Description

This program is written with Javascript on the front-end and Node.JS on the backend. Then I used Socket.IO to establish connections between users to chat.


## Future
I plan to switch from Javascript to React. This way I can make the chat app a little more optimized and accelerated. Vanilla Javascript is working well but there is room for improvement.
